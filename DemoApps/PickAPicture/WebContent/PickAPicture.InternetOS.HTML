<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Users use many different services on the web to handle their day to day
tasks, such as sharing images, editing documents and listening to music. 
They expect their applications to be connected and to work together
seamlessly.
</p>
<p>
It is impossible for developers to anticipate every new service and to 
integrate with every existing external service that their users prefer, 
and thus they must choose to integrate with a few select APIs at great
expense to the developer.
</p>
<p>
Web Intents solves this. Web Intents is a framework for client-side 
service discovery and inter-application communication. Services register 
their intention to be able to handle an action on the user's behalf.
Applications request to start an Action of a certain verb
(<a href="/share">share</a>, <a href="/edit">edit</a>,
 <a href="/view">view</a>, <a href="/pick">pick</a> etc.) and the system 
will find the appropriate Services for the user to use based on the user's
preference.
</p>
<p>
Web Intents puts the user in control of service integrations and makes the
developer's life simple.
</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>
The Web Intent API is simple to use. Service developers define the 
intent they intend to support and what to do with the data they receive.
Client applications simply initiate a new action with the given parameters.

<pre>&lt;intent
  <a href="#action">action</a>="http://webintents.org/share" 
  <a href="#type">type</a>="image/*" 
  <a href="#href">href</a>="share.html"

<dl>
  <dt id="action">action</dt>
    <dd>Required. A verb describing the action to be performed</dd> 
  <dt id="type">type</dt>
    <dd>Optional. Types are a filter</dd> 
  <dt id="href">href</dt>
    <dd>Optional. If specified, it will point to the action that is loaded 
      when the user chooses the service.  If undefined, use the current 
      page.</dd> 
</dl>

<h3 id="invocation">Invocation</h3>
<pre>var intent = new Intent("http://webintents.org/share", 
  "text/uri-list", 
  "http://news.bbc.co.uk");

window.navigator.startActivity(intent);</pre>
<h2 id="defaultintents">Default Intents</h2>
<p>
  We are collating a suite of default intents that we believe the majority
  of applications and services will use.  The schema URL used to define an
  intent is designed to be self documenting.
</p> 
<ul>
  <li><a href="/discover">Discover</a></li>
  <li><a href="/share">Share</a></li>
  <li><a href="/edit">Edit</a></li>
  <li><a href="/view">View</a></li>
  <li><a href="/pick">Pick</a></li>
  <li><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe</a></li>
  <li><a href="/save">Save</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="javascriptshim">JavaScript Shim</h2>
<p>
  This is a fundamentally new platform feature, and as such has not been
  implemented in any browser.  To compensate and to allow you to build rich
  applications today, we have built an API compatible JavaScript shim.
</p>

<p>
  It is simple to start, just drop the code following code in to your site 
  and now you will be able to get your users who use IE 8 and 9, FF 3 
  upwards, Chrome 5 upwards and Safari to use the functionality in Web 
  Intents.
</p>

</p>

<h2 id="extending">Extending</h2>
<p>
  Intents are matched based on their action and data type, neither of
  which are hard-coded into the system.  This makes extension and
  customization simple.  For example, an action verb could be an 
  activity-stream "post" and the data-type can be an activity-stream
  object of type "audio".
